CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Currently, the way schools/college canteens work is that you pay for the food and you wait for the food in line but the problem is that all the students in a facility have the same time slot for the break hence a group of people end up rushing towards the canteen at the same time this creates a lot of inconvenience for the canteen staff as well as the students and since the time is limited some students end up not eating food or wasting their food.
This is where the Canteen Management system enters it helps in streamlining the whole process wherein students can order their food via their phones beforehand from the website in which the user has to enter the college email id and then they are ready to order via e-menu and do the payments as well and this helps the college to keep a track on the canteens transactions[in case of any frauds] and as soon as a user orders anything the website will alert about it the kitchen staff and they can start preparing it. Ultimately Canteen Management System will help streamline this whole cumbersome process and change the age-old ways of doing things.
I.	SCOPE OF PROJECT  
The scope of this paper is to reduce overcrowding in restaurants, canteens, hotels by implementing a queuing system in an online food ordering platform that includes cashless payment.
II.	EXISING SYSTEM 
High crowd density during lunchtime has always been a concern that affects the various university canteens.
The current system is based on cash and paper. Due to the requirement that the customer pay the precise amount and wait for the change, the transaction and process take a long time.
Usually, People must go to canteen and order the foods and they must wait in queue for a long time to get the orders.
The canteen management system in place at the moment is ineffective, time-consuming, and error-prone.

III.	PROPOSED SYSTEM 
Online canteen system enables users to reserve their meals in advance. The users must reserve their meals on the electronic menu card.
With the suggested system, the user will have access to an electronic menu and make payments online. Using the Unified Payment Interface enhances the process of handling payments (UPI). Simple method for receiving and processing secure payments. 
 
CHAPTER 2
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Queues, file management, and paperwork for billing are all manual processes that are part of the present system for administering university canteens. This procedure may take a long time and be ineffective as well as prone to mistakes. A suggestion for improving the procedure is to adopt an E-menu system that enables consumers to access and order food electronically, doing away with the need for paper and human labour. In order to streamline the billing process, this strategy also entails data storage in a database and the availability of online payments.
A platform which digitalizes canteen has been developed to address the issue of heavy lunchtime crowding. Users can pre-order their meals on this platform and cut down on wait times by using the virtual queuing system and online meal ordering system. The platform also makes use of the Universal Payment Interface (UPI) to improve how payments are processed. With a mobile device, consumers can instantly transfer money between bank accounts via the UPI system, which offers a quick and safe payment alternative. Overall, the suggested strategy and platform aims to improve customer experience, shorten wait times, and streamline the canteen procedure. The university canteens may serve their customers more effectively and conveniently by putting these modifications into place.
